# CV_textBubbleDetection
Simple (very lightweight) text bubble detector built using openCV

Will detect and clean text bubbles from japanese manga. Make sure to install dependencies. (See the imports)
Use with decision tree for better performance - sample data file included 

Accuracy isnt great, something like 60-70%. Usually doesnt over-predict.
If you want to use it in a project, make sure to improve it first. 
No need to give credit.
